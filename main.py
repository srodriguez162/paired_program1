sentence2 = "If the implementation is hard to explain, it might be a bad idea."
result = sentence2.replace("hard", "easy")
result2 = result.replace("bad", "good")
print(result2)

# Concatenate the text "Repetition" 15 times and display the result on the screen.
# Luckily, you know that strings are multipliable and you can do this activity in a simple and elegant way.
word = "repetition "
print(word * 15)
